The data are all created by ourselves. Values are generated by online random generators from which we choose appropriate ones to construct our dataset.
In Order_History, each order ID is in the form of YY(year)+MM(month)+DD(date)+HH(hour)+A/B/C(stands for three types of service type)+XX(index of orders in the same hour HH). Other attributes are very intuitive.
